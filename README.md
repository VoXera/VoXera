# VoXera
The VoXera toolkit is an open-source NLP toolkit for the Persian language (text, speech, etc). In Voxera, we collect practical models and develop new ones with easy-to-use setups. VoXera is becoming more and more functional. Until now, we have made the following functionality available:

- [Automatic Speech Recognition](https://github.com/VoXera/VoXera/tree/master/src/VoXera/Automatic_Speech_Recognition)
  - Whisper
  - Vosk
- [Keyword Extraction](https://github.com/VoXera/VoXera/tree/master/src/VoXera/Keyword_Extraction/PerDeepKE)
  - PerDeepKE
